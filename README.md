<h1 align="center">‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó Disclaimer ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó</h1>

This is not my actual first repository but the instructions require me to type it so here it is. I've already made a GitHub account which is located at this [link](https://github.com/DragunWF) but I made a new one regardless because of a school activity. I'll post the `README.md` file of my main GitHub account here. With the addition about my favorite movies and series as per instruction.

## My Favorite Movies & Series

### Arcane

- Set in **Utopian Piltover** and the oppressed underground of `Zaun`, the story follows the origins of two iconic League of Legends champions and the power that will tear them apart.
- The delicate balance between the rich city of `Piltover` and the seedy underbelly of `Zaun`. Tensions between these city-states boil over with the creation of _"hextech"_, a way for any person to control magical energy in Piltover, and in Zaun, a new drug called _"shimmer_" transforms humans into monsters. The rivalry between the cities splits families and friends as Arcane brings life to the relationships that shape some of League of Legends' famous champions including Vi, Jinx, Caitlyn, Jayce, Viktor, and Ekko.

### Breaking Bad

- Breaking Bad is a television series that tells the story of **Walter White**, a _high school chemistry teacher_ who turns to cooking meth after he is diagnosed with lung cancer.

### Better Call Saul

- The trials and tribulations of criminal lawyer **Jimmy McGill** in the years leading up to and past his fateful run-in with `Walter White` and `Jesse Pinkman`.
- Set primarily in the early to mid `2000s` in _Albuquerque, New Mexico_, several years before **Breaking Bad**, Better Call Saul examines the ethical decline of Jimmy McGill (Bob Odenkirk), an aspiring lawyer and former con artist who becomes the egocentric criminal-defense attorney Saul Goodman, and Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), a former corrupt police officer who becomes a fixer and enforcer for drug traffickers. Other main characters include Jimmy's romantic interest and colleague Kim Wexler (Rhea Seehorn), his brother and rival Chuck McGill (Michael McKean), Chuck's law partner Howard Hamlin (Patrick Fabian), drug dealer Nacho Varga (Michael Mando), drug lord Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito), and cartel enforcer Lalo Salamanca (Tony Dalton). In addition to the primary storyline, Better Call Saul includes black-and-white flashforwards set in 2010, after the events of Breaking Bad, which explore the consequences of Saul's actions across both series.

### Mr Robot

- **Elliot**, a brilliant but unstable `cyber-security engineer` and `vigilante hacker`, becomes a key figure in a complex game of global chaos when he and his shadowy allies try to take down the corrupt corporation his company is paid to protect.
- He also happens to be suffering from a strange condition similar to _schizophrenia_ which he futilely tries to keep under control by regularly taking both legal and illegal drugs and visiting his therapist. When a strange feisty young woman named Darlene and a secretive middle-aged man calling himself `Mr. Robot`, who claims to be the mysterious leader of an underground hacking group known as `F-Society`, offer **Elliot** a chance to take his vigilantism to the next level and help them take down E-Corp, the corrupt multi-national financial company that Elliot works for and likes to call `Evil Corp`, Elliot finds himself at the crossroads. Mr. Robot, who has personal reasons for wanting to take down E-Corp, also reveals that he already has one ally, an even more mysterious, secretive and highly dangerous shadowy hacking group known only as Dark Army.
